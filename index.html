      <p>It was a dark and stormy night...</p>
      <p>It's just another Monday in the "Sunshine State."</p>
      <p>Little Timmy had no idea that this particular Monday was one he would
        remember for the rest of his life</p>
      <p>The wind and rain from Hurrican Irma blew his toy boat into the sewer drain.</p>
      <p>The light from a distant lamp post cast an erie shadow over the opening. 
        Timmy would have sworn he saw a shape resembling a person in the sewer. </p>
